          <strong>What I'm Looking For</strong>
          <p>
            I'm seeking a full-time software engineering role where I can
            leverage my technical expertise in building impactful solutions.
            With a strong foundation in software engineering and growing
            proficiency in embedded technologies, I excel in adaptable
            environments that foster continuous learning. I'm eager to
            contribute to innovative teams, whether focusing on full-stack
            development or specialized technical domains, where I can deliver
            meaningful results while expanding my capabilities.
          </p>
          <strong>Professional Journey</strong>
          <h5>VTwo</h5>
          <p>
            At V.Two, I'm developing an AI-powered document review platform that
            transforms how legal professionals interact with complex
            documentation. By combining modern React architecture with
            Microsoft's FluentUI components and efficient backend integration,
            I've created a responsive and accessible interface that handles
            large-scale document processing while maintaining optimal
            performance. My work bridges the gap between sophisticated AI
            algorithms and intuitive user experiences, empowering lawyers to
            navigate, analyze, and extract insights from vast document
            collections with unprecedented efficiency.
          </p>
          <h5>The Turn</h5>
          <p>
            One of my most recent experiences includes freelance software
            engineering, with a significant project for The Turn, a golf
            simulation company. I developed their comprehensive web platform
            from the ground up, delivering a full-stack solution that includes
            advertisement capabilities, a custom booking system, and integrated
            payment processing. This project showcases my expertise with modern
            technologies, including Next.js 15, React 18, PostgreSQL, Prisma
            ORM, Redux Toolkit, and MaterialUI. I implemented secure user
            authentication with NextAuth.js, built an administrative dashboard,
            integrated Stripe payment processing, and developed automated email
            communications using Resend API. The application is successfully
            deployed on Digital Ocean, demonstrating my ability to take projects
            from conception through development to production deployment. I
            maintain high code quality standards through ESLint, Prettier, and
            Husky pre-commit hooks, ensuring a maintainable and scalable
            codebase.
          </p>
          <h5>Cisco Meraki</h5>
          <p>
            In my previous experience as a full-stack software engineer at Cisco
            Meraki, I have been challenged and have developed a new confidence
            in the work I do. I worked on an internal design system at Cisco
            which was used by developers company-wide. I was in this position
            for about 11 months as a result of being extended twice leading to
            when I decided to resign in search for full-time opportunities. The
            highlight of my experience at Cisco was working on an agile team of
            developers, attending offsites, and most importantly, learning to
            write better code and make more meaningful contributions.
          </p>
          <h5>App Academy</h5>
          <p>
            At App Academy, I was a teaching assistant, mentoring hundreds of
            students in a highly structures three-week curriculum focused on
            foundational data structures in Javascript. I provided in-depth
            instruction on topics such as closures, threading, the call stack
            and message queue, graphs, heaps, linked lists, and more. In
            additional to technical teaching, I frequently assisted students
            with debugging operating system issues to ensure their development
            environments were correctly configured. Repeatedly teaching these
            concepts deepend my master of JavaScript and enhanced my ability to
            explain complex programming concepts clearly. This experience
            sharpened my debugging skills across multiple languages and
            environemnts, enabling me to identify and resolve a wide range of
            technical issues efficiently.
