          <strong>What I'm Looking For</strong>
          <p>
            I'm seeking a full-time software engineering role where I can apply
            my expertise in full-stack development while continuing to expand my
            knowledge in embedded software. I am particularly excited about
            opportunities that allow me to bridge my current skills with the
            challenges of embedded systems. As someone who thrives on learning
            and adaptability, I am actively building my expertise in ebedded
            technologies to complement my existing software engineering
            foundation. I am eager to contribute to a team where I can grow,
            innovate, and deliver impactful solutions, whether in full-stack or
            embedded software.
          </p>
          <strong>Professional Journey</strong>
          <h5>Freelance</h5>
          <p>
            My most recent and present experience in software has been as a
            freelance software engineer. A project I am currently working on is
            with The Turn, a golf simulation company. They needed a website that
            would equip them with advertisement, booking, and payment processing
            for their company. I tackled this project using Nextjs, PostgreSQL,
            Redux, Sass, Prisma, NextAuth, etc. I
            look forward to deploying it in the next few months to share with
            the world.

          <h5>Cisco Meraki</h5>
          <p>
            In my previous experience as a full-stack software engineer at Cisco
            Meraki, I have been challenged and have developed a new confidence
            in the work I do. I worked on an internal design system at Cisco
            which was used by developers company-wide. I was in this position
            for about 11 months as a result of being extended twice leading to
            when I decided to resign in search for full-time opportunities. The
            highlight of my experience at Cisco was working on an agile team of
            developers, attending offsites, and most importantly, learning to
            write better code and make more meaningful contributions.
          </p>
          <h5>App Academy</h5>
          <p>
            At App Academy, I was a teaching assistant, mentoring hundreds of
            students in a highly structures three-week curriculum focused on
            foundational data structures in Javascript. I provided in-depth
            instruction on topics such as closures, threading, the call stack
            and message queue, graphs, heaps, linked lists, and more. In
            additional to technical teaching, I frequently assisted students
            with debugging operating system issues to ensure their development
            environments were correctly configured. Repeatedly teaching these
            concepts deepend my master of JavaScript and enhanced my ability to
            explain complex programming concepts clearly. This experience
            sharpened my debugging skills across multiple languages and
            environemnts, enabling me to identify and resolve a wide range of
            technical issues efficiently.
